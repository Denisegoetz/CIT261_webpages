      <h2>Animations</h2>
      <p>Animations bring a webpage to life. They give the appearance of elements moving on the page. In CSS, there are two main ways to move things on a webpage. The transition property is one way and the other is the animation property + keyframes. On my topic 9 page, it is explaned in more detail. This is more of a collection of animations on this page.
          
      <p>One note on performance and animation: The most Performant Properties for Animation are position, scale, rotation and opacity. These properties do not cause a repaint of elements or a reflow, which is costly from a performance standpoint.</p>

       <h2>Animating Text</h2>
       <div class="example2">
         <h3>Slide-in text.</h3>
           <p>The examples below are ways to animate text. One example, looks like a marquee that you could have scrolling at the top of your page like an advertisement. Remember, if you have too much of this kind of thing, it can be an annoying user experience.

       <div class="example6">
        <p><b>Scrolling up...</b> Once upon a time there were three little pigs and the time came for them to leave home and seek their fortunes. Before they left, their mother told them " Whatever you do , do it the best that you can because that's the way to get along in the world.  The first little pig built his house out of straw because it was the easiest thing to do. The second little pig built his house out of sticks. This was a little bit stronger than a straw house. The third little pig built his house out of bricks.</p>
