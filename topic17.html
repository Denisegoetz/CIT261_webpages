            <p>While learning genealogy, I often wondered why is this so hard to grasp? I started learning genealogy over 20 years ago. Back then, we had to send away for birth and death certificates to local government agencies. Genealogy Research has evolved with online resources and even DNA testing to help us discover our ancestors. The Ancestry commercial on television has a women that describes her genealogy search as if she put in a few names and majically she discovers that her cousin is George Washington. While it is possible to discover branches of your relatives as easy as that, that it not the norm. This site helps a person gain genealogy knowledge faster to get them working on the tree. </p>
